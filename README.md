# Battleship Galactica

Welcome to Battleship Galactica, a game where you can become a Space Cowboy and fight epic battles against Rocket Rancher (a second player) or Megatron (the AI). The size of the galaxy where the fight takes place is adjustable by gridsize. 

## Getting Started
To play the game, simply run the executable JAR-file. If you are launching the application from an IDE and not from the JAR-file, run the main in the GUI folder, which can be found in the controller package. If you are running the tests, navigate to the \emph{CucumberTest} file and run it.

## Preparing for Battle
To prepare for the looming battle, different types of ships can be selected and placed around the galaxy. You can also apply varying degrees of upgrades based on how confident you feel about the fight of the century. Upgrades include asteroids that can block attacks and planets that can pull a shot into its orbit and rebound it in another direction. 

## Weapons at Your Disposal
As a highly advanced spaceship, multiple weapons will be available for you to use in battle. These include:

- A cannon that shoots at a single point
- A grenade that shatters on impact and spreads around the surrounding areas
- A laser that cuts through the galaxy in a straight line

## Winning the Battle
The fight only stops when a winner emerges by having exploded all the opponent's ships. 

Thank you for playing Battleship Galactica. May the force be with you!
