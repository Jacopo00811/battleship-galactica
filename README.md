# Battleship Galactica

Welcome to Battleship Galactica, a game where you can become a Space Cowboy and fight epic battles against Rocket Rancher (a second player) or Megatron (the AI). You can choose to battle in the Triangulum (small), Milky Way (medium), or Andromeda (large) galaxy.

## Getting Started
To play the game, simply run the executable JAR-file. If you are launching the application from an IDE and not from the JAR-file, run the Main class from the GUI controller package. If you are running the tests, navigate to the  **CucumberTest** file and run it.

## Preparing for Battle
To prepare for the looming battle, different types of ships can be selected and placed around the galaxy. You can also choose different game conditions based on how confident you feel about the fight of the century. Options include asteroids that can mislead the shooter and planets that can pull a shot into its orbit and rebound it in another direction. 

## Weapons at Your Disposal
As a highly advanced spaceship, multiple weapons will be available for you to use in battle. These include:

- A cannon with unlimited cannon balls that shoots at a single point
- 3 grenades that shatter on impact and can wipe out a greater area
- 1 laser that cuts through the galaxy in a straight line

## Winning the Battle
The fight only stops when a winner emerges by having exploded all the opponent's ships. 

Thank you for playing Battleship Galactica. May the force be with you!
